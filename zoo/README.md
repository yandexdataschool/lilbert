# lilbert.zoo

This folder is for collecting intermediate experiments and results that are currently too incomplete to be put to the main directory. Let's try to make the code for the experiments as clean and readable as possible so that other people can understand and reproduce them with minimal effort. Following PEP-8 guidelines and using python scripts (instead of creating large code blocks in jupyter) are greatly encouraged.

For each experiment, there should be a separate directory.
