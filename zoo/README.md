This folder is for the experiments that are currently too incomplete to be put to the main directory. Please try to make the code for the experiments as clean and readable as possible, so that other people can understand and reproduce them with minimal effort. Following PEP-8 guidelines is encouraged.

For each experiment, there should be a separate directory.
